Download the zip-file or clone the project. Open index.html with live server(visual studio) or run locally on a server.

I've also implemented a snake game into the website, it's located in the top right corner, simply click on the "snake" on the index.html site.![start](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70509004/112964651-d0b30c80-9148-11eb-9a83-43df9afe5025.jpg)
